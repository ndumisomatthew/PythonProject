    "Application Programming Interfaces (API) are mechanisms that allow for two software components to communicate using a set of definitions and protocols. API functionality is explained in terms of client and server, where the application sending a request acts as a client and the response application acts as the server (Amazon Web Services, 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "API's are able to function in four ways based on when and why they were created: SOAP APIs, Wbsocket APIs, RPC APIs, REST APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we will look at REST APIs. REST(Representational State Transfer) APIs are the most popular and functional APIs available. The REST  defines a set of functions such as (GET, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that clients may use in order to access server data exchanged using \"HTTP\". The main feature of REST API is statelessness, meaning that servers don't save client data between requests (Amazon Web Services, 2023). "

The request library abstracts away the complexities of making HTTP requests (Schoonvel. J, 2012).

    "In the first segment of the code above a count is equated to zero in order to keep of the number of movies being searched (will be used for the storing). This else statement runs when the user's input is an existing title where the information is available on omdb's database. The for loop I used is so I can iterate through every title and then count them so that I'm able to generate the list where the user will later select which number(index) they're looking for (the movie they want i.e. Star Wars has multiple episodes). The list I'm able to display using the **print(f\"{count}.lst['title']} ({lst['year']})')** which will give me the name and year of the movie release in order for the user to select which title they had in mind. The user is able to make that selection via an input (user_index1) which I have accounted for errors for using a try and except to curb agaisnt a full \"crash\" in the event the user enters something besides an integer. The final_title assignment is where I faced a struggle as when I ran it without the subtracting the 1 I would get stuck. However through the help of a friend in Firga I learnt that the -1 is neccesary becuase the list starts at 0 and the count starts from 1 so subtracting the 1 balances the code out. I then added another try and expect to curb an event where the user inputs a value outside the available list range. With the user's desired index giving a final_title value I then assigned title_info with movie_title[final_title] **(title_info=movie_title[final_title])**  which will be the selected movie's inforamtion for the user's desired movie. I then needed to retrieve the information for the title so I defined title_finder and used an if statement to check that if the title is in the movie information using selected_info.key():to parse through and grab the title inside the dictionary/json output and then taking that exact title and assigning it title so I can use the omdb.title() to search for the exact letter by letter title and then print it out to my user using the assigned variable I named output_info (which gives the information desired by the user) instead of them typing the full name in from the get go.

    "The code above is a function definition that will be used in the event a user calls for option 2: Where they will access they're last search title. The code uses an if statement paired with an exist fnction to check whether or not the desired file exists and (this is to account for an empty file that hasn't been made due to no search ever being entered). the code then assigns tytle to open the fhand variable assigned to open the file, then reads the information inside the file. The code then prints the name of the title (file content) using an f format, and then a prompt is run using an input( ) function to ask if the user would like to obtain further information on the title. Using an if statement the programs runs a response to the user's answer of yes/no on whether they'd like more inormation on the title. In the event the user wants more information p_output{omdb.title(tytle)}  is assigned with the omdb.title( ) api function which will take the title name (tytle) and search for that specific title and have it presented to the user by running a for loop to iterate through the JSON (dictionary) output and print the key and value items which will then be presented.

    "* Obtaining the OMBD API key proved to be trivial due to the site's UI making it difficult to visually find where to select the free package to use in order to get an API key to progress. \n",

    "\n",
    "    the response was a 401 (unauthorised) which was baffling due to the request prompt working with the poster link. My solution was simple: go on YouTube a search for tutorials on how to get it done, I watched the following videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbLc5a9jdXo&t=44s, https://youtu.be/E39a7kQfjSg\n",
    "    They were not very helpful so I decided to look at lecture 17 again for angles \n",
    "    After not making progress I discovered I had an invalid API key because I had not activated the key and thus obtained a new key which gave the desired output using Pandas after reading the omdb documentation which I had missed in the project description\n",
    "* After being able to figure out the way to get my desired information in a Pandas dataframe, when requestion more information using the ['imdb_id'] call I was unable to create the dataframe, potentially I can store the information in a csv and then print it. \n",
    "* I set out a new approach where I define a function to search for the movie but the try and except statement was not running the excpect and so that had me stuck, when encountering a situation of a user entering a title that does not exist, my issue was calling a new variable which when run was not assigned instead of re-calling the assigned one I had used in in the try block. The try and except also wouldn't account for the second time being an error by the user and implementing a while loop was difficult given the time constraint and project references \n",
    "* In defining my get_by_title() function I faced the challenge of when assigning for final_title variable as when I ran it without the subtracting the 1 I would get stuck with an output for the wrong title. However through the help of a friend in Firga I learnt that the -1 is neccesary becuase the list starts actually at 0 and the count starts from 1 so subtracting the 1 balances the code out as Python will always start from 0. \n",
    "* Additionally having my data have a final output as a DataFrame in the function was challenging as the data would be messy and not orderly, thus conventionally using the json dumps & loads methods along with some dictionary iteration and indexing was an easier approach for me to use. \n",
    "* One of the bigger challenges I faced was storing the title output that I would get from the get_by_title() function variable the error I would get after running my definition within the definition was that the run code would give me an error stating that the the variable text_title was called before assignment and when I ran it differently assiginig it to stored_info[text_finder] the same error would occur despite me defining both variables within the get_by_title() function. My solution was to try either 1. Store the information without defining a new function within the function or only storing the information later in the second shortened code block. \n",
    "* The historic data function was then resolved by creating a file inside the get_by_name function that allowed for a writing of the text title to the file for later use in the history() function. "
